create a python file called Shortest_Path_GUI that imports the class Game that I gave you. 
It starts with a window with a heading on top of it saying "Shortest Path" with a line at the bottom of the heading.
Under the line there will be a grid that represents the Game's self.board with size len(board) by len(board).
for every cell on the board:
if it has a 0 cell should be blank
if it has a 1 cell should have an image on the cell from the path = "blockpath" resize to fit the cell
if it has a 2 cell should have an image on the cell from the path = "targetpath" resize to fit the cell
if it has a 3 cell should have an image on the cell from the path = "sourcepath" resize to fit the cell
when running Shortest_Path_GUI.py create an instance of Game class by calling game = Game(defult_board)
under the grid there will be a "Solve" button. When pressed run "path = game.solve"
for every i in range(1, len(path))
    sleep for 2 seconds
    render the image "sourcepath" on grid[path[i][0]][path[i][1]] and delete the image on grid[path[i-1][0]][path[i-1][1]]
